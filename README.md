## September 2018 09 24 (Monday) - Understand How Students Learn

### Importance of Prior Knowledge

In their book **"How Learning Works: Seven Research-Based Principles for Smarter Teaching"**, Ambrose, Bridges, Lovett and others (2010) discuss how faculty can gauge the extent and nature of students' prior knowledge.  These strategies include;

1. Talk to your colleagues. Consider talking to your colleagues who teach prerequisite courses that students are expected to complete. You may ask them about the contents that was covered, the type of assignments completed, the assignments students struggled to complete and why, the areas or topics students enjoyed, and so on.  For online instructors, one may consider reviewing the prior online course or the syllabus for the course for information such as list of textbooks, reading materials used, etc. The information gathered should help you know the content that was covered and the depth of coverage, as well as skills that were mastered. This information would help as you design instructional activities for your course.

2. Use low-stake assignment or quiz. To find out what prior knowledge students bring to your class you may consider giving a low-stake assignment or a quiz early in the semester.  Student's performance on this kind of assessment will be a good indicator of the skills and knowledge they already possess.  Such assessments may include having students write an essay, take a multiple choice quiz, or complete a short answer quiz that examines students understanding of concepts and definition of terminologies that students are expected know.

3. Self-assessment of prior knowledge.  Another efficient strategy for assessing students’ prior knowledge is to provide them with the opportunity to assess their own knowledge and skills. Such self-assessments should be low-stake and anonymous to encourage candid responses. The intention is to gain an overall idea of the range of skills and knowledge of your student and not to judge individual student's performance.  Questions could focus on the prerequisite skills, knowledge and experiences expected of your students as well as the skills and knowledge that student will be expected to leave the course with. Students could be asked to rate themselves on a scale with items such as; 1= I have heard of the term, 2 = I can define the term, 3 = I can explain the term to a colleague, 4= I can use the term to solve a problem. Students' responses should assist the instructor to plan appropriate instructional activities that could enhance students learning.

## November 2018 11 27 (Wednesday) - Uncovering Pedagogical Content Knowledge

### Why Pedagogical Content Knowledge?

Anne had a chemistry teacher her sophomore year of high school who had an impressive background working in the field. She knew the subject matter perfectly, so most people would assume that her knowledge made her a great teacher. After all, the most important thing is for the teacher to know what they teach inside and out, right? Well, yes... and no. Anne learned through her experience with Mrs. Johnson that she needed more than a teacher who knew her subject well. She needed one who also knew how to teach it well. So, while Anne's teacher knew chemistry like the back of her hand, she didn't seem to know how to explain it, illustrate it, and make it understandable to Anne and her classmates. For someone who wasn't the greatest with formulas and science to begin with, Anne really needed more assistance.

As it turned out, Anne wasn't the only student who needed more from her teacher. In 1986, Lee Shulman, an educator and researcher, noticed that all students need a teacher who is more than knowledgeable about their subjects. They also need one who can teach their specific subjects clearly and effectively. He called this combination of content and teaching knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge.

So, back to our first scenario with Mrs. Johnson. If she had combined her knowledge of chemistry with class exercises, creative examples, and careful explanations, she would have displayed pedagogical content knowledge. She also would have been a more successful teacher.

**Pedagogical content knowledge (PCK)** was introduced by Shulman in 1986 and refers to the knowledge teachers use to translate particular subject matter to students, taking into account possible (mis)conceptions, relationship between knowledge of teaching materials, how to transfer the subject matter, and leveraging students' prior knowledge.

## Topic 1: Apply Adult Learning Principles in Training
> **This section discusses application of adult learning principles in training delivery.**

**1.1 Malcolm Knowles' andrology theory can be stated with six assumptions related to the motivation of adult learning:**

- **Need to know**: Adults need to know the reason for learning something.
- **Foundation**: Experience (including error) provides the basis for learning activities.
- **Self-concept**: Adults need to be responsible for their decisions on education; involvement in the planning and evaluation of their instruction.
- **Readiness**: Adults are most interested in learning subjects having immediate relevance to their work and/or personal lives.
- **Orientation**: Adult learning is problem-centered rather than content-oriented.
- **Motivation**: Adults respond better to internal versus external motivators.


## Topic 2: Design a Learning Experience
> **This section discusses designing lesson plans for a short learning experience applying the understanding of adult learning principles, active learning qualities and instructional methods.**


## Topic 3: Prepare and Facilitate a Learning Experience
> **This section discusses preparing and facilitating an active learning experience for learners.**
