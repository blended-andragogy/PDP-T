# My PDP-T Learning Journey & Teaching Portfolio

## Topic 1: Apply Adult Learning Principles in Training
> **This section  discusses application of adult learning principles in training delivery.**

Malcolm Knowles' andrology theory can be stated with six assumptions related to the motivation of adult learning:
1. **Need to know**: Adults need to know the reason for learning something.
2. **Foundation**: Experience (including error) provides the basis for learning activities.
3. **Self-concept**: Adults need to be responsible for their decisions on education; involvement in the planning and evaluation of their instruction.
4. **Readiness**: Adults are most interested in learning subjects having immediate relevance to their work and/or personal lives.
5. **Orientation**: Adult learning is problem-centered rather than content-oriented.
6. **Motivation**: Adults respond better to internal versus external motivators.
