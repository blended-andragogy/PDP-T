## Topic 1: Apply Adult Learning Principles in Training
> **This section  discusses application of adult learning principles in training delivery.**

**Malcolm Knowles' andrology theory can be stated with six assumptions related to the motivation of adult learning:**
1. **Need to know**: Adults need to know the reason for learning something.
2. **Foundation**: Experience (including error) provides the basis for learning activities.
3. **Self-concept**: Adults need to be responsible for their decisions on education; involvement in the planning and evaluation of their instruction.
4. **Readiness**: Adults are most interested in learning subjects having immediate relevance to their work and/or personal lives.
5. **Orientation**: Adult learning is problem-centered rather than content-oriented.
6. **Motivation**: Adults respond better to internal versus external motivators.


**Why Pedagogical Content Knowledge?**
Anne had a chemistry teacher her sophomore year of high school who had an impressive background working in the field. She knew the subject matter perfectly, so most people would assume that her knowledge made her a great teacher. After all, the most important thing is for the teacher to know what they teach inside and out, right? Well, yes... and no. Anne learned through her experience with Mrs. Johnson that she needed more than a teacher who knew her subject well. She needed one who also knew how to teach it well. So, while Anne's teacher knew chemistry like the back of her hand, she didn't seem to know how to explain it, illustrate it, and make it understandable to Anne and her classmates. For someone who wasn't the greatest with formulas and science to begin with, Anne really needed more assistance.

As it turned out, Anne wasn't the only student who needed more from her teacher. In 1986, Lee Shulman, an educator and researcher, noticed that all students need a teacher who is more than knowledgeable about their subjects. They also need one who can teach their specific subjects clearly and effectively. He called this combination of content and teaching knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge.

So, back to our first scenario with Mrs. Johnson. If she had combined her knowledge of chemistry with class exercises, creative examples, and careful explanations, she would have displayed pedagogical content knowledge. She also would have been a more successful teacher.


## Topic 2: Design a Learning Experience
> **This section discusses designing lesson plans for a short learning experience applying the understanding of adult learning principles, active learning qualities and instructional methods.**


## Topic 3: Prepare and Facilitate a Learning Experience
> **This section discusses preparing and facilitating an active learning experience for learners.**


## Topic 4: Interpret the Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications System
> **This section interprets the Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications System and a set of National Competency Standards and apply them in a learning and development context.**


## Topic 5: Assess Competence
> **This section discusses preparing and conducting a competency-based assessment to assess competence.**


## Topic 6: Prepare for Continuing Professional Development
> **This section discusses objective reflection upon his or her own training/teaching practice to engage in continuing professional development for improvement.**
